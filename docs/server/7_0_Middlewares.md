## Middlewares

Middlewares are functions that are executed before the route handler. They are used to perform common tasks such as authentication, authorization, and validation.

### Application Middlewares

- [`userStatus`](7_1_Middlewares_UserStatus.md) - middleware that checks if the user is authenticated and if the user's account is verified.
