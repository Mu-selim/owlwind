## Controllers

Controllers are the glue between the routes and the models. They are responsible for handling the request and response objects. They are also responsible for calling the appropriate model methods to perform CRUD operations on the database.

### Application Controllers

- [`auth`](6_1_Controllers_Auth.md) - authentication controller which handles user registration, login, logout, and account verification.
